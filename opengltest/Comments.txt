BUGS:
Transparent lines 1px wide being drawn in randomly.

Baker: Bugs and glitches:

- flashing black line when walking

- shooting:

    - when tapping shoot, not all shots affect enemies 

    - a lot of shots do not collide with enemies; sometimes do damage without collision, 
     other times, shots simply go through enemies without damage 

       *edit: both glitches occur even when not tapping rapidly, as well as whil holding 
        down spacebar*

- updated desert level has cut off cactuses (cacti?)

- when exiting level from boss area to hub, player appears to flash on the right side from 
 where you spawn for a split second before returning to proper position
 
- when walking, if player stops in the middle of the walk animation, the character remains
 in that position until player physically moves into idle stance
