||		| Stun			  ||	Double check your projectile code. You may have to make a few changes to the projectile class inorder to make it work the way it needs to.
||		| Constant AOE	  ||	Should create one projectile every frame with the width and height of the desired aura size. Ask Ashley for art assets when you are ready to put them in.
||	X	| Laser			  ||	Bonny: I was just going to have it leave mine like projectiles on the ground, also I have the duration set so it can last for one frame if you want it too.
