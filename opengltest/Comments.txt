BUGS:
Transparent lines 1px wide being drawn in randomly.
Only first item dropped is actually drawn.

Baker: Bugs and glitches:

- flashing black line when walking

- shooting:

    - when tapping shoot, not all shots affect enemies 

    - a lot of shots do not collide with enemies; sometimes do damage without collision, 
     other times, shots simply go through enemies without damage 

       *edit: both glitches occur even when not tapping rapidly, as well as whil holding 
        down spacebar*

- updated desert level has cut off cactuses (cacti?)

- when exiting level from boss area to hub, player appears to flash on the right side from 
 where you spawn for a split second before returning to proper position

 - exiting the feild level, if you hold the s button even after going through the door to exit, you walk thruough the bottom hub wall

- when walking, if player stops in the middle of the walk animation, the character remains
 in that position until player physically moves into idle stance

- Just asked a random person on the bus to play the game, they found a spot in the game where you couldn't glitch (f key) out, which was really 
 weird.
 (field level, boss area, behind the rock on the left of the door, between the rock and the
 trees) *edit, i can't get stuck there, i keep trying, but it isnt working.*
