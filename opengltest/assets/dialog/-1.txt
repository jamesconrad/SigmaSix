Hello there! Do you need me for something?

Oh, it's really hot in there!
It takes you right to the caves within a volcano. 
I saw some of Dr.Douche's men take a girl in there. 
Her name was Lysandra, I believe.

To a forest! It's autumn there, and actually quite lovely,
if you can get past the people trying to kill you...
Actually, they were dragging around this guy yelling something about potato salad...
I think his name was Batata.

There's a barren desert and ruins behind that door.
Not much scenery, especially with the goons trying to shoot you.
I think a guy named Kyred was taken there, actually. Poor guy.
