Just a field. A bunch of those jerks too, who shoot anything that moves,
and literally do not speak. At all. 
Some girl named Asami got dragged there. 
Sucks to be her.

A lab. I don't know what even happens in there. 
With all the guys shooting in there, I'm surprised 
it hasn't been blown up yet. 
That poor Conrad guy isn't going to last long in there.

The castle is in there. Pretty fancy, 
although the people in there are FAR from any kind of royalty.
Some guy named James went in there, and I'm not sure he's gonna get out.
